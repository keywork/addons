SilentRespec 1.0.8
by Animal
----------------------
SilentRespec is a small and simple addon created to allow hiding the "learned/unlearned" messages when switching dual specs or re-speccing yourself or your hunter pet.
Although not respec related, SilentRespec also allows you to hide the earned/lost titles messages mainly because of the 'patron/matron' spam in certain areas and with certain trinket effects.
The functionality of the addon should work for all locales but the options window currently has no translations.

Access the SilentRespec options window through the standard addon section of the World of Warcraft interface options window, or by using the /SilentRespec or /sr chat commands.
There are only a handful of options for which "learned/unlearned" messages to hide and when to hide them.
---------------------
Options include:

Hide Dual Spec "Learned" Messages. - If checked, this option hides all messages from your chat frames about skills or spells "You have learned" when switching your primary and secondary specs.

Hide Dual Spec "Unlearned" Messages. - If checked, this option hides all messages from your chat frames about skills or spells "You have unlearned" when switching your primary and secondary specs.

Hide Re-Spec "Learned" Messages. - If checked, this option hides all messages from your chat frames about skills or spells "You have learned" at any time unless switching your primary and secondary specs.

Hide Re-Spec "Unlearned" Messages. - If checked, this option hides all messages from your chat frames about skills or spells "You have unlearned" at any time unless switching your primary and secondary specs.

Hide Hunter Pet "Learned" Messages. - If checked, this option hides all messages from your chat frames about skills or spells "Your pet has learned" at any time.

Hide Hunter Pet "Unlearned" Messages. - If checked, this option hides all messages from your chat frames about skills or spells "Your pet has unlearned" at any time.

Hide titles earned/lost messages. - If checked, this option hides all messages from your chat frames about earning or losing any "title," such as the Patron and Matron titles.
