    #Helya
    *Improved tentacle strike code so warning is slightly faster and less antispam is needed.
    *Cancel cast bar for infusion when interrupted
    *Update fury of maw timer if infusion isn?\226?\128?\153t interrupted
    *Fixed fury of maw phase 3 mythic timer. Accidentally pasted phase 2 mythic timer into phase 3 somehow.
    *Fixed phase 3 taint of sea timers not showing, the unit event doesn?\226?\128?\153t show in phase 3.
    #Guarm
    *Added optional off by default yells to the other 2 licks on guarm. I still think they are pointless but the other mod does it so i figure someone will ask for them eventually so make it an option.
    
    #random nightmare fixes
    *Fixed a voice pack bug where dark storm voice option had wrong spell id in it, causing special warning sound to still play on top of voice sound, as well as the voice option to not appear in UI.
    *Changed mark timer to be off by default on dragons since most don?\226?\128?\153t use that either. more clutter reduction. Further, there is a bug where the two dragons can sometimes desync as much as 2 seconds on applying this buff. when this happens timer ends up getting screwed up anyways.

    Fix infoframe bug on guarm where it only showed two of 3 debuffs (showed one of them twice)
    Fixed warnings so they also fire for JUMPed debuffs as well on guarm
