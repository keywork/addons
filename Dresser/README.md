Dresser
==================
Expand your dressing room and character dialog with additional features:
- Additional model control button with the following dropdown menu:
 - Equip targeted player gear onto the shown model
 - Set the model to your targeted player or creature
 - Change race and gender
 - Undress slots (or everything)
- For the sake of legacy users, the expected shortcut buttons for Undress, Target Gear, Target model and Player model are still present.

Try out other peoples gear without them knowing. Check yourself out as the opposite gender and other races, make informed decisions when paying to customize your character!
