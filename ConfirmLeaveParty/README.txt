ConfirmLeaveParty
====================

Asks for confirmation when you try to leave a party or raid group while
you are in a dungeon or raid instance.

There are no options. If you prefer not to have to click the dialog, you
can also press Enter to confirm, or Escape to cancel.

As of Patch 5.1, the game itself now asks for confirmation when you try
to leave an LFD/LFR group before the instance is finished, so this addon
is not particularly useful anymore, and will no longer be updated unless
it breaks. If you would like to continue using this addon to ask for
confirmation when leaving normal groups in instances, you will need to
check the "Load out of date addons" box for future game patches.
