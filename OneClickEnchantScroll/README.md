# OneClickEnchantScroll
**A World of Warcraft UI AddOn**

OCES provides a button in your tradeskill window to create enchantment scrolls with a single click. The button also displays the number of enchanting vellums in your inventory.

I cannot guarantee compatibility with other tradeskill addons that replace or heavily modify Blizzard's default tradeskill UI. If you're experiencing issues with another Tradeskill Addon, drop a comment on [Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/oces), [WoWInterface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info18907-OneClickEnchantScroll.html#comments) or [GitHub](https://github.com/patrickjDE/OneClickEnchantScroll/issues) and I'll look into it.
